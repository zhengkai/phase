Thanks to a certain Chrome extension that quietly served me for about 14 years—until it got banned by damn Chrome for having an outdated manifest version. So I spent two days writing this one with manifest v3.

Please don’t send any suggestions or requests for help.  
If I run into a bug myself, I’ll fix it. Otherwise, it’s either not a bug—or it’s tolerable.
